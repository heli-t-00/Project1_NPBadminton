# N & P Badminton Club and Coaching (N&PCC)

## Introduction

I’m building a website for N&PBCC to give the club a stronger online presence beyond just a Facebook and Instagram page. The founders are qualified Level 2 coaches who runs badminton club night session as well coaching sessions for both juniors and adults. A website will make the club easier to find through search engines. It will act as a central hub for current members to access club information, view scheduled sessions, and potentially attract new members to grow the community.

In addition to hosting play and coaching schedules, the site can potentially will offer users a convenient way to check session availability. There would be potential to create a member database where attendees can register their interest, track payments, and manage their session bookings in one place. This platform can potentially streamline club management while improving the experience for everyone involved.

## Requirements

- Design and build an **interactive front-end web application** using HTML and CSS, following principles of user experience (UX) design, accessibility, and responsiveness.
- The website will include three key pages: **Home, About, and Contact.**
- Create a **README.md** file that describes all aspects of the project.
- The website will address a specific target audience (or multiple related audiences) and be designed with UX and accessibility principles in mind.
- Ensure the website is **fully responsive** across mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- Deploy the website on **GitHub.**


## Website Design Overview

When designing the website, my focus was on creating an intuitive experience. I wanted users to immediately understand the purpose of the page, even if they arrived via a quick Google search. The wireframe was crafted with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices. The color scheme centers on shades of purple and blue, inspired by the branding logo, to maintain visual cohesion and brand recognition.

## Testing
The pages have been tested on Chrome
The website is responsive and looks good on all standard screens using the devtool device.
Nav bar changes to an icon bar when viewed on smaller devices.

- Testing
W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project. 
All the test came back with no errors.
- Responsiveness 
When testing for responsiveness of the webpages, there are issues with the contact.html, where the contact us form is not displayed correctly on all devices. I am currently working on fixing this issue.

Secondly, another known issue is the header on all devices, the addition of the N&P Badminton logo had impacted on how the header is displayed, on mobile or tablet devices the header appears over two lines.

Lastly, the hamburger nav bar is too close to the edge of the pages on all devices, need to amend.
