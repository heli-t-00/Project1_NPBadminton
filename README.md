# N & P Badminton Club and Coaching (N&PCC)

## Introduction

I’m building a website for N&PBCC to give the club a stronger online presence beyond just a Facebook and Instagram page. The founders are qualified Level 2 coaches who runs badminton club night session as well coaching sessions for both juniors and adults. A website will make the club easier to find through search engines. It will act as a central hub for current members to access club information, view scheduled sessions, and potentially attract new members to grow the community.

In addition to hosting play and coaching schedules, the site can potentially will offer users a convenient way to check session availability. There would be potential to create a member database where attendees can register their interest, track payments, and manage their session bookings in one place. This platform can potentially streamline club management while improving the experience for everyone involved.
